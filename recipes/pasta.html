    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces penne pasta</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot, minced</li>
            <li>3 small garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package brown mushrooms, stems removed and thickly sliced</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a stockpot over medium-low heat. Add shallots; stir and cook for about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mushrooms with flour and stir to coat. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Sprinkle some rosemary and thyme into your hand and crush herbs to release the oil. Add them to the pot on top of the mushrooms and stir. Add a grind of salt and pepper. Stir and taste.</li>
            <li>Pour heavy cream into the simmering pot and stir to combine. Let it cook and bubble up for a few moments, then mix in cream cheese and stir until cream cheese has melted. Taste. Remove pot from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese if the mixture needs a little more salt.</li>
            <li>Stir sauce again and add pasta. Stir. Turn out mixture into a large, wide-rimmed bowl. Sprinkle parsley on top. Serve hot.</li>
